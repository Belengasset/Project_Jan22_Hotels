## OBJECTIVE
---
To demonstrate and put into practice everything learned in ironhack during the first part of the bootcamp I present the following project.

The project I have chosen consists of analyzing and contrasting the ranking of the 100 best hotels of 2022 and 2021 proposed by Travel and Leisure magazine.

What is **Travel+ Leisure?** Travel + Leisure is a travel magazine based in New York City, New York. It publishes 12 times a year and has 4.8 million readers, according to its corporate media kit.

## Future objectives
----

As future objectives it would be interesting to make a comparison with more databases such as booking or/and airbnb and see if other users really have the same opinions and later make a comparison of user opinions.

It would also be interesting to see what the users think about the hotels that are repeated both years in the magazine and to analyze the comments, both good and bad.
